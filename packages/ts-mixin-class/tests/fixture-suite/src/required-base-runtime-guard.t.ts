// not only by the compiler. `.mix(Unrelated)` where `Unrelated` does not descend from
// the mixin's required base throws (`applyRuntimeMixin` -> `classExtends` is false).
// The compile-time rejection is covered by `generic-mixin-required-base.t.ts`, and the
// raw runtime helper (`mixinChain` + `defineMixinClass`) by `runtime-helper.t.ts`. This
// probes the *transformer-emitted* `.mix` of a real `@mixin()` class end-to-end — a
// distinct plane: a regression in how the emitted `.mix` wires through to the guard
// would slip past the raw-helper test. Reached by bypassing the static `.mix` signature.
